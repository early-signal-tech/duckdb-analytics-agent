# TPC-H Queries: Reference and Test Questions

The 22 standard [TPC-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/) decision-support queries, for testing the agent against a dataset with known correct answers. The SQL is DuckDB's own copy (`tpch_queries()`), with its default parameters.

## Setup

```bash
uv run agent_harness.py --tpch --save-db tpch.duckdb --no-run   # once; add a scale factor, e.g. --tpch 1
uv run agent_harness.py --db tpch.duckdb --quiet --prompt "<a question below>"
```

Tables: `customer`, `lineitem`, `nation`, `orders`, `part`, `partsupp`, `region`, `supplier`. Scale factor 0.1 (the `--tpch` default) has 600,572 line items; 0.01, 0.1, and 1 have published answers.

## Checking an answer

Run the reference SQL in a session on the same database, or compare with DuckDB's published answers (which exist for scale factors 0.01, 0.1, and 1 only):

```sql
INSTALL tpch; LOAD tpch;
SELECT * FROM tpch_answers() WHERE query_nr = 1 AND scale_factor = 0.1;
```

Pass means the agent's numbers match the reference result, not that its SQL matches the reference text: any correct query is fine. Several questions are hard to ask in plain language (Q19, Q22), so also judge whether the agent states its assumptions.

Run each question below with `--prompt`, one run each, and compare `agent_runs` in the traces (status, iterations, cost).

| Q | Topic | Hard part for an agent |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pricing summary report | basic |
| 2 | Minimum cost supplier | correlated subquery |
| 3 | Shipping priority | top-N with a join chain |
| 4 | Order priority checking | basic |
| 5 | Local supplier volume | basic |
| 6 | Forecasting revenue change | basic |
| 7 | Volume shipping | nation-pair logic |
| 8 | National market share | conditional ratio |
| 9 | Product type profit measure | six-table join |
| 10 | Returned item reporting | basic |
| 11 | Important stock identification | HAVING with a subquery threshold |
| 12 | Shipping modes and order priority | basic |
| 13 | Customer distribution | outer join, count of counts |
| 14 | Promotion effect | basic |
| 15 | Top supplier | max over a CTE |
| 16 | Parts/supplier relationship | NOT IN subquery, count distinct |
| 17 | Small-quantity-order revenue | correlated average |
| 18 | Large volume customer | IN with grouped HAVING |
| 19 | Discounted revenue | three OR'd profiles |
| 20 | Potential part promotion | nested correlated subqueries |
| 21 | Suppliers who kept orders waiting | EXISTS / NOT EXISTS |
| 22 | Global sales opportunity | substring, scalar subquery, anti-join |

## Q21. Suppliers who kept orders waiting

**Question:** Which 100 SAUDI ARABIA suppliers were the only late supplier on a multi-supplier order that could not be fulfilled?

```sql
SELECT
    s_name,
    count(*) AS numwait
FROM
    supplier,
    lineitem l1,
    orders,
    nation
WHERE
    s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
    AND o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
    AND o_orderstatus = 'F'
    AND l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            lineitem l2

## Q22. Global sales opportunity

**Question:** Among customers in specific country codes with above-average balances and no orders, how many are there and what is their total balance, by country code?

```sql
SELECT
    cntrycode,
    count(*) AS numcust,
    sum(c_acctbal) AS totacctbal
FROM (
    SELECT
        substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) AS cntrycode,
        c_acctbal
    FROM
        customer
    WHERE
        substring(c_phone FROM 1 FOR 2) IN ('13', '31', '23', '29', '30', '18', '17')
        AND c_acctbal > (
            SELECT
                avg(c_acctbal)
